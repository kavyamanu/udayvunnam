# UdayVunnam

You can call me [Uday](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udayvunnam/) 👋

Like every seasoned developer, I enjoy coding😊. I mostly work on the frontend, but can work on any part of the stack.

I am a T shaped developer and often enjoy ☕️. I work across the spectrum of UI, UX, and API. 

I occasionally find time to write about my work and things that are worth sharing. Experienced in various domains like IIOT, Finance, Logistics, and eCommerce

I have some OSS libraries created in Javascript space(React, Angular, Node). 

While working with the humongous set of node_modules, I often find myself reading the code than the documentation. Thanks, VSCode for that(You know you can directly search [node_modules](Search node_modules).
